we monitor the committed instruction for coverage of ALU operation 
including arith and mul/div

alu_instr_cg/operand_is_32b : operation with 32 bit operands , e.g. ADD/SUB/XOR
alu_instr_cg/operand_is_5b  : operation with 32 bit operands , e.g. SLL/SRA/SRL
alu_instr_cg/mul_div	    : mul/div operation
